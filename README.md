## Instructions

In the sections folder you will find three sections to complete for this exercise.

You have `Art`, `Users` and `Advice`.

The aim of the exercise is to practice fetching data nad rendering lists.

Inside each section folder you will find:

- a `index.js` file for the logic of each section **build everyhting here and then break it down into components**
- a `template.html` that shows you an example of what your React components should create. Take note of `className` to get the styling working.
- a `components` folder with suggested components to create so you can practice props.

For each section you will need to make a fetch request using the following APIs:

Art - https://api.artic.edu/docs/#introduction
